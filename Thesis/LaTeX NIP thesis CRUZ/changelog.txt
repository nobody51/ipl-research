1.2 Social Dynamics
-gramatical error, specified what dynamics is modeled

2.1.2 Parameters
-rephrased how transitional probabilities "a" and "b" were introduced

2.1.3 Functions
-rephrased how the feedback function was explained
-changed "the equation" to "Equation ( )"
-included a discussion on figure 2.1

2.2 Simulation Algorithm
-fixed how equations were refered to

3.1 Steady-state equation for different cases
-rephrased how the color represented different beta values
-indicated that the phase space plots are the analytical steady-state values

3.2 Simulation experiments
-indicated how the system settles very early in the simulation
-removed the claim that the vertex is unpredictable and thus unstable

3.2.1 Unstable Points
-rephrased as indicated in the revisions

4 Incorporating Spatial effects
-explained where real life applause was taken from

4.1 Different Configurations
-fixed grammatical errors
-rearranged format of figures for ease of reading
-update spatial configuration images so theta is more easily visualized

4.3 Finding the parameters
-more in-depth discussion as to why the model fails
-included how the parameter set was achieved
-included the fitting function to the real and simulated applause
