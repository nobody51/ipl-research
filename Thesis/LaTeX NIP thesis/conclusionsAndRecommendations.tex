\hspace{\parindent} In this thesis, we have reviewed the definition of the revival time associated with the wave packet revival phenomena. We have obtained approximate analytical expressions for the classical time scale $T_{cl}$ and quantum revival time scale $T_{rev}$ for the single- and double- $\delta$-perturbed infinite square well system.
