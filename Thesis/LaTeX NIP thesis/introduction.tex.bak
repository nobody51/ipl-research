\section{Background of the study}

\hspace{\parindent} The quantal time development of wave packets in simple potentials has been a subject of interest since the dawn of quantum mechanics. The discussions by Schr\"{o}dinger and others on the connections between the classical and quantum descriptions of nature were made by showing explicit wave packet solutions to some familiar problems, including the cases of the harmonic oscillator and free-particle \cite{robinett}.
